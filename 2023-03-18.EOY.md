# End of Year Review Notes 2023-2024

## Development

### Simulation Mode & Skip Mode

* Added more comprehensive testing of simulation mode.
* Allowed simulation mode to be changed at any time before task start. This
  allows users to broadcast changes to simulation mode.

### Other features

* Cylc PYTHONPATH - was able to come up with a more elegant way of doing 
  this than initially planned - modifying the `sys.path` inside Python
  rather than modifying the wrapper script. (Copied this solution to Rose)
* Added support for Cylc flow to run on Python 3.12

### Example Bug fixes

* Continued to add small features to Cylc lint.
* [Nasty Xtrigger caching bug](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/5791) - only the
  first xtrigger was working if a task had multiple xtriggers.
* [Execution time limit polling intervals](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/5753) 
  were not being correctly calculated.
* [Broadcasting changeds to execution time limit](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues/5891)
  didn't work.
* [VIP Bug](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/5909) - where
  a user reported CLI arguments which didn't work.

## Review

* Worked with Hilary to ensure `cylc set` is well tested. Contributed to
  tests and fixed bugs on Hilary's branch.
* Checked Oliver's new integration-reftest infrastructure to replace
  several reference tests with integration tests which run much faster.


## Support

* Regularly helping users with Cylc, Rose, SPICE.
  * Surgeries
  * Online channels
  * Helped users with SPICE
* Took part in Joe Hickson's Cylc Training.
